  <p>I'm currently a Master's student studying computer architecture at Penn State. I'm applying for EECS graduate programs. My interests are diverse; the field doesn't matter so much as the work I do. I mainly want to build cool things that work well, and I want to do it alongside a great team.</p>
  <p>I'm also available for internships and co-ops. I love working on software, especially in languages and on platforms I know nothing about. I have modern C++ experience (both in personal projects and <a href="https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/d18e0892dcabb921e226354f0c50c95a8b15f4b1">as a developer on Chrome</a>), solid C and Linux experience through coursework, and some professional Java experience working on internal tools at Google.</p>
